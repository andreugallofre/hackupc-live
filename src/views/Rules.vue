          Whatever the reason that leads you to participate in this hackathon,
          make sure you maintain the spirit of non-competitive collaboration
          that this event wants to establish. Although there will be awards, the
          most important thing is to get good projects that help research for
          the COVID-19.

        <ol>
          <li>
            There is no minimum number of members per team, although it is
            recommended to be 4. If there were more than 4, then the maximum
            number would be 5 people.
          </li>
          <li>
            Needleless to say, teams can get advice and support from organisers,
            volunteers, sponsors and others.
          </li>
          <li>All work on a project can starts off before the hackathon</li>
          <li>
            Teams can use an idea they came up with before the event, as long as
            it follows the theme of the hackathon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teams can work on ideas that they have already worked on before or
            that they have already carried out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their
            projects.
          </li>
          <li>Projects that break the Code of Conduct are not allowed.</li>

            Data protection and intellectual property rights shall be complied.

          Once the hacking is over, the teams will show their projects to each
          other in a Demo Fair format.
        </p>
        <p>
          We prompt you to present a demonstration of what you have created and
          to share the knowledge gained.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also encourage you to submit what you have carried out, even if the
          hack does not work or you have not been able to finish it. It is okay
          if you didn’t get what you expected, it happens very often. The demo
          is an opportunity to share with others what you have learned and what
          you have tried to create, and this is the magic of hacking and
          hackathons. If there is nothing you can show, you could give a
          presentation about what you have tried and what you have learned.
          Listening to what other people have learned is always interesting and
          inspiring to other attendees.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will only be eligible for the awards if you give a presentation.
          The prizes will be evaluated according to the judging criteria.

          people and make new friends.
