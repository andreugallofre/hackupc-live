            <ol>
              <li>There is no minimum number of members per team, although it is recommended to be 4. If there were more than 4, then the maximum number would be 5 people.</li><br/>
              <li>Needleless to say, teams can get advice and support from organisers, volunteers, sponsors and others.</li><br/>
              <li>All work on a project can starts off before the hackathon</li><br/>
              <li>Teams can use an idea they came up with before the event, as long as it follows the theme of the hackathon.</li><br/>
              <li>Teams can work on ideas that they have already worked on before or that they have already carried out.</li><br/>
              <li>Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects.</li><br/>
              <li>Projects that break the Code of Conduct are not allowed.</li><br/>

            Once the hacking is over, the teams will show their projects to each other in a Demo Fair format.<br/><br/>
            We prompt you to present a demonstration of what you have created and to share the knowledge gained.<br/><br/>
            We also encourage you to submit what you have carried out, even if the hack does not work or you have not been able to finish it. It is okay if you didn’t get what you expected, it happens very often. The demo is an opportunity to share with others what you have learned and what you have tried to create, and this is the magic of hacking and hackathons. If there is nothing you can show, you could give a presentation about what you have tried and what you have learned. Listening to what other people have learned is always interesting and inspiring to other attendees.<br/><br/>
            You will only be eligible for the awards if you give a presentation. The prizes will be evaluated according to the judging criteria.
