Through clinical data collected by more than 120 paediatricians in Catalonia we are seeking to identify which symptoms can predict that a child has COVID and which of them have not been connected to this disease. With your collaboration, we will be able to save many unnecessary tests on those boys and girls and to generate an algorithm or clinical score that allows us to identify properly each of them. We can make it! We are convinced that you will help paediatricians in Catalonia and around the world to work better in the future."

In particular, we will illustrate the complete process using cough and non-cough audio files, import metadata to the model, and show the performance of the trained model when evaluated with new data. Finally, we we will show how to build a chatbot in Telegram that can be used to obtain information from the user and include this knowledge to the model."

There is meaning hidden in plain view in the sentence, acting as modifiers of the information found. Recognising what events are negated or uncertain can radically change everything, and in clinical texts it can be critical for decision making and diferential diagnosis. Also, the presenter will point you to a youtube channel with a few more talks that you can look at and ask for any doubt you have."

Do you want to know how they feel and what they think? ‚ÄúCOVID-19 and empathy: being in their shoes‚Äù is an activity that will allow you to get to know some of the situations that ICU nurses experience in their everyday lives and which some patients have to face. The aim of the activity is to promote empathy towards those whom COVID-19 touches personally in order to be able to see the world of COVID-19 from another perspective and to be able to develop technological tools focused on those people. The activity consists of viewing two videos, which are very short and are recorded in real hospital settings. One of the videos will allow you to see through the eyes of a nurse and the other one through those of a patient. Once the visualisation is over, you will need to fill in a short questionnaire that aims to encourage reflection and to make us question the ability to connect with the other and its impact. Are you ready to go into an ICU? If so, go ahead."
